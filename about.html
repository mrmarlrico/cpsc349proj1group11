    <h2>Project Description & Credits</h2>
    <p>
      This project was designed by Geoff Mendoza, Marl Kristoffer Rico, Derek
      Nguyen, and Maria Ortega. This is a website that we designed to display
      stock images of deserts that were taken by numerous different
      photographers. These photos were provided to us by Pexels, a free stock
      photo and video website that is shared by many creators.
